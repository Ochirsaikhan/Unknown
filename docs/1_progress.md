## Using a Markdown `list`, detail the tasks you've completed and describe your progress.

* Found the quotes database.
* Converted it into TXT file.
* Made a function to generate quotes by using markovify.

`I've found the relevant quotes database from the Internet, and converted the JSON file to TXT file, so that I can base my markovify model on a string file. I've successfully implemented a function to generate a random three line quote using markovify. Some of the quotes generated were surprisingly thought-provoking, and I was shocked to read some of the quotes like "Life is not worth living". It was strange, and yet inspiring to see what a computer program has to say. This part of the project turned out as I hoped if not better.`

## Using a Markdown `list`, detail the tasks you still have yet to do. Where are you stuck? Where do you need help?

* Figuring out how to place my quote on an image.
* Figuring out how to find relevant images online, and use it in my program.
* Making the random name generator.

`I'm having a hard time to make a random name generator using markovify. It's not working at all. So, I might need to find other ways to do it. The more important and I guess more difficult part of my project is to randomly find images and put my quotes on them. I don't know how I should implement a program to put texts on image and what kind of modules to use.`

## Celebrate your successes. What are they?

`My successess in this project up until now were correctly converting the JSON file into TXT file and using that TXT file to make a function that generates a human-readable quote.`
