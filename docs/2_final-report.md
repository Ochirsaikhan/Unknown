# Course project final report

`Ochirsaikhan`

## Final title

`"UNKNOWN" Author.`

## If you used any data sources, what were they and why?

`I have used "quotes.json," which I have found on the Internet, to get my markovify base corpus text. I've extracted only the quotes from the JSON file and saved it into "quotes.txt so that I can use it. Also, I've used the "DeliusSwashCaps-Regular" font for my quotes.` 

## How did the final project end up? Were you able to achieve your ideal (or close to it)?

`The final project ended up exactly what I imagined. It was exciting to achieve the result I had in my mind from the beginning. This was the very first programming project I've worked on on my own. Reading the documentation, solving the problems I had, and learning along the way was definitely an eye-opening and nice experience. Moreover, as I worked on my project, I improvised on my idea and code to make it more interesting.`

## Did your project change over time? If so, how?

`YES! First, as I was working on my project, I decided to draw this line below my quote to make it look more appealing. I also chose not to use a random-name generator because it didn't make any sense to put someone's name under a quote when in reality, no one said it but a computer. Hence, my project's name changed to '"UNKNOWN" Author.' Also, I decided to use only landscape images because portrait images made my font size smaller because their width was short. Therefore, it made it difficult to read the quote when I was using portrait images. However, if the quote happened to be short, it was fine, but I decided to use only landscape images. Lastly, I decided to blur my background images a little bit so that the quotes could stand out more. I didn't think about it before, and it made it easier to read the quote.`

## Describe your approaches and experience with the project.

### What worked?

`Experimenting with the code, reading the documentation, and watching tutorials were key to figuring out how I could achieve certain results. Writing down and imagining in my head about how I could achieve or solve problems was also important. The Jupyter Notebook is really helpful for separating certain parts of the code and only running that part. I really love that feature of Jupyter Notebooks.`

### What didn't?

`Just staring at my code and not doing something about it because I was stuck somewhere was something that didn't work. I realized that sometimes the code wouldn't work my way even though I've tried everything to achieve that result. I understood that it's essential to keep experimenting with the code until you reach your goal.`

### What would you have done differently?

`I would have implemented a code that changes the font color based on the background image's color. Using only black for my quote is very limiting because when a black background image is selected, it becomes difficult to see the quote clearly. Also, I would have implemented a way to figure out the font size that suits a portrait image.`


### What was the biggest challenge that you overcame? How did you do it?

`Frankly, my biggest challenge was to figure out how to place that "UNKNOWN" author below the line. Calculating the coordinates was somehow tricky, and I tried so many codes to implement that until I realized that I could just use the "anchor" parameter to achieve my result. Placing the "UNKNOWN" at the center below my quote was difficult because sometimes the font size will be bigger and the "UNKNOWN" part would extend out of the line. I even tried to implement a separate "author_font" to wrap that "UNKNOWN" text around the line so that it won't extend out of it. It was my bad not experimenting with all of the parameters and ignoring it, thinking it was about something else. Nevertheless, I learned an important lesson.`
