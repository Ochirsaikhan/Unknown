# Course project idea

## Title

`They said...`

## Description of project

`I'm going to make a program that generates random quotes based on hundreds of quotes. I hope the markovify module will work here. I'm hoping that if I provide enough quotes like quotes from Albert Einstein, Abraham Lincoln, etc., I can generate random wisdom quotes. I'll also generate random names. For example, 
"..." by random name. 
Finally, I'm going to add these quotes to images that are quote-worthy. Or, I may find pictures of random people or animals and put the quote on the image. The end result is funny, smart, and inspirational quotes on a quote-worthy and moody picture. The pictures may be nature images, images of intelligent people like Steve Jobs, Nicola Tesla, etc. The picture possibilities are endless, and I hope I will find a suitable public image database.`

### If you plan to use any data sources, what are they and why?

`I'm going to use a "quote" data source if there are any. I think I'll find it somewhere on the internet. I'm going to use images, and I'm also going to find an image database consisting of nature pictures. I'll also find a database containing names so that I can pull out random names.`

### Tentative description of ideal output

`My ideal output is that the quote is somehow really inspirational, and I hope that the image and the quote correlate or connect with each other. I'm going to end up with a picture with a quote on it that may mean something.`

## Statement of motivation/interest

`I think getting a randomly generated quote from a computer program will be really interesting to read. Also, putting that quote on an image makes the end product complete.`

## Perceived or realized challenges

`My perceived challenges are:
1). Making a working program that is able to generate readable quote based on quotes I provide it with using markovify.
2). Finding the needed databases.
3). Making a random name generator.
4). Putting the random generatod quotes on an image.
5). Finding correlated images.
6). Figuring out the length of the quote and where should I put the quote on the image.`
